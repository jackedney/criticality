- Guardrails reviewed: yes
- No-commit run: false
- Commit: fc530c3 feat(US-001): Initialize TypeScript project with strict mode
- Post-commit status: clean
- Verification:
  - Command: npm run build -> PASS
  - Command: npm run typecheck -> PASS
  - Command: npm run typecheck:strict-test -> PASS (correctly catches implicit any)
  - Command: npm run lint -> PASS (placeholder)
  - Command: npm run test -> PASS (placeholder)
- Files changed:
  - package.json (ESM config with type: module)
  - tsconfig.json (strict mode settings)
  - src/index.ts (placeholder source)
  - test-fixtures/implicit-any-example.ts (negative test case)
  - test-fixtures/tsconfig.json (config for negative test)
  - AGENTS.md (build instructions)
- What was implemented:
  - Created package.json with type: module for ESM
  - Created tsconfig.json with strict: true, noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true, exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true
  - Created src/index.ts placeholder that compiles without errors
  - Created test-fixtures to verify implicit any fails typecheck
  - All acceptance criteria verified and passing
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript strict mode with noUncheckedIndexedAccess and exactOptionalPropertyTypes catches many common errors
  - test-fixtures pattern useful for verifying that TypeScript settings work as expected
  - Placeholder scripts for lint/test acceptable since those are separate stories (US-003, US-004)
