### US-011: Implement Decision Ledger override/invalidate operations
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-010

Description:
As a developer, I want to mark decisions as superseded while preserving history so that decision evolution is tracked.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Implement supersede method that marks old decision as superseded
- [ ] Supersede links old and new entries
- [ ] Original entry preserved (append-only invariant)
- [ ] Respect confidence levels in override rules
- [ ] Canonical decisions require explicit override flag
- [ ] Example: supersede decision A with B marks A as superseded and links to B
- [ ] Negative case: attempting to implicitly override canonical decision returns error
