### US-002: Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a developer, I want automated CI/CD so that code quality is enforced on every push and PR.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create .github/workflows/ci.yml
- [ ] Workflow runs on push to main and all PRs
- [ ] Workflow runs lint, typecheck, and test steps
- [ ] Workflow fails on any lint errors, type errors, or test failures
- [ ] Caches node_modules for faster runs
- [ ] Example: PR with failing test blocks merge
- [ ] Negative case: PR with syntax error in workflow file is detected
