### US-014: Add Decision Ledger query interface
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-013

Description:
As a developer, I want to query decisions by various criteria so that specific decisions can be retrieved efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Filter decisions by category
- [ ] Filter decisions by phase
- [ ] Filter decisions by status
- [ ] Filter decisions by confidence level
- [ ] Get active decisions only (excluding superseded)
- [ ] Get decision history including superseded entries
- [ ] Get decisions by dependency graph
- [ ] Example: query by category 'architecture' returns only architecture decisions
- [ ] Negative case: query with invalid filter key returns error
