### US-015: Define ProtocolState enum
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-004

Description:
As a developer, I want a state representation for protocol phases so that the orchestrator state is well-defined.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create enum covering all phases: Ignition, Lattice, CompositionAudit, Injection, Mesoscopic, MassDefect, Complete
- [ ] Add Blocking substate for any phase
- [ ] Add Failed substate with failure context
- [ ] Define ProtocolState type combining phase and substate
- [ ] Example: ProtocolState can represent 'Ignition' phase in 'Active' substate
- [ ] Example: ProtocolState can represent 'Lattice' phase in 'Blocking' substate with query
