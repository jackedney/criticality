### US-012: Implement Decision Ledger cascade (dependency tracking)
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-011

Description:
As a developer, I want dependency tracking with cascade invalidations so that dependent decisions are properly managed.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Record dependencies on append
- [ ] Invalidating a decision cascades to dependents
- [ ] Detect and prevent circular dependencies
- [ ] Generate cascade report showing affected decisions
- [ ] Example: invalidate decision A cascades to dependent decisions B and C
- [ ] Example: cascade report lists all affected decisions
- [ ] Negative case: creating circular dependency A->B->A returns error
