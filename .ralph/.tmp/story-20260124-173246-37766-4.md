### US-004: Set up testing infrastructure with Vitest
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As a developer, I want a testing framework configured so that I can write and run tests efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Install and configure Vitest for unit/integration tests
- [ ] Install and configure fast-check for property-based testing
- [ ] Enable coverage reporting
- [ ] Add npm scripts: 'test', 'test:watch', 'test:coverage'
- [ ] Create example test file that passes
- [ ] Example: 'npm run test' runs tests and reports results
- [ ] Example: property test with fast-check generates multiple test cases
- [ ] Negative case: failing test causes npm test to exit with error code
