### US-010: Implement Decision Ledger append operations
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-004

Description:
As a developer, I want to append decisions to the ledger so that all decisions are recorded.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Create Decision type matching ledger.schema.json
- [ ] Create Ledger class with append method
- [ ] Auto-generate unique IDs for new decisions
- [ ] Auto-set timestamps on append
- [ ] Schema validation on append
- [ ] Detect and reject duplicate IDs
- [ ] Example: append decision returns decision with generated ID and timestamp
- [ ] Negative case: append decision with invalid schema returns validation error
