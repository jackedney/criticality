### US-013: Implement Decision Ledger serialization/deserialization
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-012

Description:
As a developer, I want to persist and reload the ledger so that decisions survive restarts.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Serialize ledger to JSON matching ledger.schema.json
- [ ] Deserialize and validate on load
- [ ] Handle corrupted files gracefully with clear error
- [ ] Atomic writes prevent partial corruption
- [ ] Example: save and reload ledger preserves all decisions
- [ ] Negative case: loading corrupted JSON returns descriptive error
